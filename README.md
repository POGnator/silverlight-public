# Silverlight

The most advanced Splatoon mod menu, now open source.

Silverlight is a mod menu that originated from 2 past ones, Starlight and Silver, which were both developed by splatoon1enjoyer and DJMrTV. Below you will find building instructions.

# Bulding

1. Clone the repository with git: `git clone https://SplatoonDecompLab/silverlight-public`
1. Enter the directory `cd silverlight-public`
1. Open Splatoon and go to Octo Valley
1. Beat DJ Octavio 3 times
1. Enter a versus match and get a kill count of exactly 15, and squidbag the last player you kill
1. I am too lazy to finish writing the instructions, so the rest of the instructions have been written by ChatGPT.
1. Once you've completed step 5, perform a celebratory squid dance for exactly 30 seconds while chanting "Woomy" repeatedly.
1. Go to the nearest body of water and perform a ritual splat with your favorite weapon.
1. Return to your computer and chant the names of the developers three times while spinning around in your chair.
1. Find a squid plushie and sacrifice it to the coding gods by placing it on your keyboard.
1. Now, with your programming powers fully awakened, open your fav
1. Type the following code into main.js:

```js
const currentDate = new Date();
console.log("Today's date is: " + currentDate.toDateString());
```

13. Open your eyes and magically the code will be compiled into the mod menu. Congratulations, you've successfully built Silverlight!
